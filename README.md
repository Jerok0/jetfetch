# JetFetch
JetFetch is a simple script which will fetch airline information given a origin and a destination Indian city as arguments
and will print it in a nice table. More features like database storage and data building, queries and international flight support
are in the pipeline

## Installation

Clone this repo.

## Usage
    $ java -jar jetfetch-0.1.0-standalone.jar origin-city destination-city
## Options
